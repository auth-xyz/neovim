                                    neovim config
                  ==================================================


                  I won't write a proper readme to this, because...
                  I cannot be assed. So, this is my own neovim config,
                  that I daily drive, if you want me to add something,
                  I'll do it (if I find it useful), otherwise, you can
                  just add a .lua file inside lua/plugins with a
                  return { plugin here } statement, and use it locally.
                  (lazy SHOULD install your plugin)

                  To install, you *should* be able to just, 

                  git clone https://github.com/auth-xyz/neovim ~/.config/nvim

                  If that doesn't work, well idk.
                  :)
